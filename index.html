            Visual Studio is an offline coding platform that can be used to create websites, games, and more. Here's how to set it up so one can get coding. First, you have to download the software; You can download it at https://code.visualstudio.com/. Next, after you agree to the terms and conditions, pick a place for it to download, and some other things, open the software. They may prompt you with selecting a color theme, and that decision is yours to make. If you don't like the options they have for you there, then you could download a different color scheme by going to Extensions (the icon to the left of the screen with four blocks). After that, you make a file to store your code (_.html for HTML files, _.css for CSS files, and _.js for Javascript files). Lastly, you can go ahead and code whatever you'd like!

            The console screen can be used to review code, identify errors, and many more things. To open the console screen, you would right-click a webpage, and then scroll down to "Inspect". Next, look at the top of the window that just popped up. You would see a tab titled "Console". Click on that, and you're in the console! Now, if you want to print anything on the console, all you have to do is type the following: console.log("Example: Hello, world!")
            You would then be able to see this message on the console screen, if coded correctly.
